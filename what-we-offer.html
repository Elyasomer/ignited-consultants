                    <p>
                      With IGNITED Consultancy, we are determined to introduce appropriate learning objectives and
                      meaningful strategies that will promote learning and an active working structure that is aimed at
                      developing a positive mindset.
                      Establishing measurable goals that helps to define what the learner can achieve once the
                      curriculum has been put in place.
                      Currently, we are working with the education department in Kyrgyzstan to strengthen the
                      English/Kyrgyz curriculum making it more accessible and family/student driven. </p>

                    <h4>Teacher Training</h4>
                    <p>
                      As Consultants and teachers, we are acutely aware of the needs of the teachers and their
                      professional development.
                      We offer a comprehensive training plan that focuses on the needs of the teacher and the
                      school/college. We know that some training sessions can be cumbersome and underwhelming, our
                      training days are purposely designed to deliver an immersive package that is created in a fun and
                      absorbing way. Upon completion of the training day, you will be given a certificate to add to your
                      CPD development programme.
                      <br>
                      We believe that you should leave the training day feeling good about what you have done.
                      Just as you would want your students to leave the classroom – you are no different.
